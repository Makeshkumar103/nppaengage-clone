        <h4>The Industry Leader in NP|PA Engagement</h4>
        <p>As a trusted partner of over 70 pharmaceutical and medical device companies, we use our deep insights into the NP|PA audience to develop marketing strategies and programs that change prescribing behavior and increase brand loyalty.</p>
        <p>We reach more NP|PA prescribers than any other agency, and we get better results. A deep understanding of NPs|PAs is needed in creating unique messaging and materials — which should not be the same as marketing materials created for MDs.</p>
